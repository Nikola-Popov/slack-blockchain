## Development
### Installation and local development scenario

The following prerequisites must be fulfilled:
   - you need to be a contributor to the project. Otherwise you won`t be able to configure the app
   - download [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) allowing secure introspectable tunnels to localhost

### Clone

- Clone this repo to your local machine using one of the links
   - SSH `git@github.com:Nikola-Popov/slack-blockchain-app.git`
   - HTTPS`https://github.com/Nikola-Popov/slack-blockchain-app`

### Setup

- Navigate to the cloned directory.

```shell
$ cd slack-blockchain
```

- In order to build the project and run all the tests execute.

```shell
$ mvn clean install
```
- After the build is successful we can run the project by navigating to the slack-app submodule and executing it from there,

```shell
$ cd slack-app
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```
- Open another terminal window and run the ngrok. By default the application runs on port 8080 so ngrok with map this port.

```shell

- Finally, go to https://api.slack.com/apps and if you have the right acess you should see the app there. Manually configure the`Slash Commands` and the `Interactive components` request urls with the url provided by ngrok.
